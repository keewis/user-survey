- Better deal with geospatial and geosciences operations: climatology taking into account the calendar, annual cycles, spatial average taking into account the weights or make a weight with the latitude, etc. (I have a few function to deal with monthly data here that would need to be improved, but I'd love to have these kind of function natively in xarray, adapting to the frequency of the data/calendar : https://github.com/mickaellalande/PhD/blob/master/utils/clim.py), all these would need to be well documented and warmed when lauching the code for knowing what we do, with some option to make it available or not. The weighted function is already a big improvement, but doesn't work with complex operations. Making a copy of the CDO (Climate Data Operators) would be the best I guess!

- Supporting geospatial regridding in particular with xesmf for example or anything else native that takes into account the sphericity of earth (not like the scipy one implemented right now).

- Better plot support ? I don't know if it's the goal of xarray, but so far I use the plot just for quick overview but never for making real figures. I actually use proplot right now that have way better option than matplotlib I find, but it's in a early stage development. But I would love to have an esay way of making projection, etc. without having to import cartopy and complex formater. Just as in proplot: proj='cyl' makes it work (with cartopy and matplotlib under the hood: https://proplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projections.html).
